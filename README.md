# descriptives-nydischarges
HHA 507 // Week 4 // Assignment 4 // Part 3

## in this repo, we implement lessons from Part 1 and Part 2, found at: https://github.com/kezzhou/descriptives-scipy and https://github.com/kezzhou/descriptives-realpython/blob/main/scripts/realpython.py respectively. 

## the dataset that this repo is centered around is the familiar SPARCS 2016 dataset found at https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/gnzp-ekau

## The repo is notably split into three sections. The first section organizes columns by categorical and numerical data into a TableOne table, which conveniently and cleanly displays data that can be exported into a csv

## The second section focuses on drawing descriptive statistics into a readable and easily understable format from the dataset for potential clients. We utilize multiple imports such as (but not limited to) pandas and numpy.

## the final section focuses on simple visualization as an aid to supplement our statistical data. This section focuses on matplotlib.

## All csvs are not pushed with the repo to avoid GitHub committing issues based on size limits
